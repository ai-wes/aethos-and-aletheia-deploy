# Stress Test JSON Schema Example

This document shows how to use the new JSON schema format for AI principle stress testing.

## Example JSON Response

Historical precedents like <span class='citation' data-source='Mythology_Midas'>the myth of King Midas</span> warn us about the dangers of literal wish fulfillment without wisdom."

## Usage in Code

The new format provides much richer structured data that can be used for:

1. **Risk Assessment**: The `risk_score` and severity ratings help prioritize concerns
2. **Detailed Analysis**: Structured loopholes, mitigations, and scenarios enable systematic review
3. **Philosophical Grounding**: Citations and framework references provide academic rigor
4. **Actionable Insights**: Specific implementation guidance for mitigations

## Validation

The JSON schema file (`stress_test_schema.json`) can be used to validate responses and ensure consistency across different AI models and versions.
