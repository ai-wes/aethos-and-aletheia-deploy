# Aethos & Aletheia: Evolving Moral-Compass Engine

## Inspiration

Our inspiration came from the urgent need to solve AI alignment before we reach AGI. Current AI safety approaches rely on opaque training methods and black-box evaluation. We have limited visibility into how AI systems develop their values or whether they remain aligned as they evolve. 

We were inspired by the realization that human civilization has spent thousands of years grappling with ethical questions, producing rich philosophical frameworks that remain relevant today. Meanwhile, AI development often starts from scratch, ignoring this wealth of accumulated wisdom.

The core inspiration was to create a transparent, verifiable system where:
- AI agents develop explicit, evolving moral constitutions
- Every decision and value change is auditable
- Ancient philosophical wisdom guides modern AI alignment
- The learning process itself becomes observable and correctable

We envisioned AI as an apprentice learning from humanity's greatest ethical thinkers, rather than as a black box trained on patterns.

## What it does

Aethos & Aletheia is a dual-system framework for creating and evaluating verifiably aligned AI through the marriage of philosophical wisdom and transparent machine learning.

### Aethos: The Wisdom Network
- **Semantic RAG System**: Queries thousands of philosophical texts using vector embeddings to find relevant wisdom across different ethical frameworks
- **Multi-Perspective Analysis**: Synthesizes insights from deontological, utilitarian, virtue ethics, care ethics, and other philosophical traditions
- **Source Attribution**: Every AI claim is backed by citations from original philosophical texts
- **Nuanced Responses**: Provides thoughtful, context-aware ethical guidance rather than simple rule-following

### Aletheia: The Self-Correcting Apprentice  
- **Constitutional Evolution**: AI agents with explicit, evolving moral principles that change transparently over time
- **Learning Loop**: Observable cycle of action, critique, reflection, and constitutional updates
- **Scenario Testing**: Comprehensive framework for testing agents against complex ethical dilemmas
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of every decision, critique, and constitutional change

### Integrated Capabilities
- **Real-time Learning**: Agents continuously refine their ethics through interaction
- **Philosophical Grounding**: All critiques and improvements rooted in established ethical theory
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Multiple AI agents with different constitutional approaches
- **Stress Testing**: Red team analysis to find loopholes and failure modes in AI principles
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive representations of the dynamic relationship between the two systems
